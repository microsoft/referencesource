# .NET Reference Source

The referencesource repository contains sources from [Microsoft .NET Reference Source](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/)
that represent a subset of the .NET Framework.  This subset contains similar functionality to the class libraries that are being
developed in [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime).  We intend to consult the referencesource repository as we develop
.NET Core.  It is also for the community to leverage to enable more scenarios for .NET developers. 

**Please note that the referencesource repository is read-only**. [See this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-open-source/) for the rationale.

Questions, bugs, and pull requests should be done through [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime).
