# .NET Reference Source

If you landed here via redirect from https://referencesource.microsoft.com/ and this repo with .NET Framework reference sources does not meet your need please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource/issues/new/choose).

The referencesource repository contains sources from [Microsoft .NET Reference Source](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/)
that represent a subset of the .NET Framework.  This subset contains similar functionality to the class libraries that are being
developed in [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime).  We intend to consult the referencesource repository as we develop
.NET Core.  It is also for the community to leverage to enable more scenarios for .NET developers. 

**Please note that the referencesource repository is read-only**. [See this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-open-source/) for the rationale.

This repository does not accept feature requests or bug reports. To submit those, you need to go elsewhere:

* [.NET Framework](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/dotnet)
* [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core)
